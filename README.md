## 🔍 Overview

The PSA Role Signal Analyzer is a diagnostic tool designed to detect **role inflation, misalignment, and systemic inversion** in job descriptions and organizational structures. This Lite Version is publicly available to demonstrate the framework’s signal diagnostic capacity.

Originally developed as part of a **Responsible AI job application package**, this tool reflects the core tenets of Presence Signaling Architecture (PSA™), a system-level design framework for surfacing structural bias, role opacity, and authorship erasure.
